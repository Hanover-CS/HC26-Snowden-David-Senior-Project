# Integrating Express.js with Supabase: A Complete Tutorial

## Welcome

This tutorial teaches you how to build a RESTful API backend by connecting **Express.js** with **Supabase**, enabling you to create full-stack web applications with secure database access and real-time capabilities.

---

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this tutorial, you will be able to:

1. Set up an Express.js server with proper project structure
2. Connect Express.js to a Supabase PostgreSQL database
3. Handle environment variables securely for local and production environments
4. Deploy your Express + Supabase backend
6. Debug common connection issues between Express and Supabase

---

## Target Audience

This tutorial is designed for:

- **Intermediate JavaScript developers** with basic knowledge of Node.js and npm
- Developers building their **first full-stack application** who need a backend API
- Students working on **course projects** requiring database integration
- Anyone who wants to learn **modern backend development** with managed databases

**You should be comfortable with:**
- Writing JavaScript/Node.js code
- Using the command line/terminal
- Basic understanding of REST APIs (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
- Git and GitHub basics

---

## Prerequisites

Before starting this tutorial, ensure you have:

### Required Software
- **Node.js** version 18 or later ([Download here](https://nodejs.org/))
- **npm** (comes with Node.js) or **yarn**

## Tutorial Structure

This tutorial is divided into three progressive sections:

### [Part 1: Project Setup and Installation](part1-setup.md)
Learn how to initialize a Node.js project, install dependencies, and configure your development environment.

**Time estimate:** 15 minutes

---

### [Part 2: Creating Your Express Server](part2-express-supabase.md)
Build a basic Express.js server with routing and middleware, and understand the core concepts of Express applications.

**Time estimate:** 20 minutes

---

### [Part 3: Testing and next steps](part3-testing-nextsteps.md)
Set up a Supabase project, create a database table, and establish a connection from your Express server to Supabase.

**Time estimate:** 25 minutes

---


## What You'll Build

Throughout this tutorial, you'll build a **course management API** that allows you to:

- Create new course records
- Retrieve all courses or a single course by ID
- Update existing course information
- Delete courses from the database
- Test the connection between Express and Supabase

This serves as a foundation for more complex applications like course review platforms, learning management systems, or any application requiring structured data storage.
