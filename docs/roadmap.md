# **EduRate: My Web Application to make students Informed**
- The goal of this project is to create a functional web application for my fellow students to further inform them  about suggested or disapproved courses and professors.
  In order to inforce the integrity of the web application a review will be automatically generated for courses and professors based on the scores of an assigned survery. This allows the students to still find the nesscary knowledge they need to make a informed decision on there schedules without spreading hate about our facilty.

## **Key Capabilites**
- Survey-Based Feedback: Students rate courses and professors using structured surveys instead of writing free-form reviews.

- Auto-Generated Reviews: The system analyzes survey results to automatically generate clear, neutral summaries.

- Upvoting System: Reviews can be upvoted, helping highlight the most credible and helpful feedback.

- Integrity Focused: Prevents hate speech or personal attacks by removing open-ended review submissions.

- Course & Professor Lookup: Students can easily browse or search for reviews before registering.

## Annotated Bibliography

### 1. RateMyProfessors

- **Link:** [https://www.ratemyprofessors.com](https://www.ratemyprofessors.com)
- **Type of Source:** Primary source – a publicly available web platform.
- **Relation to EduRate:** Competing program. Offers professor/course reviews.
- **Description:**  
  RateMyProfessors is a long-standing website where students anonymously post reviews about professors and courses from colleges and universities. Reviews include numeric ratings and open-ended comments, categorized by helpfulness, clarity, and easiness.
- **Feature Analysis:**  
  While RateMyProfessors is popular, it suffers from major issues EduRate aims to solve—unmoderated, subjective comments can lead to bias, defamation, or offensive content. Its open-ended review format allows for hate speech or irrelevant feedback. EduRate improves on this by replacing open text with structured surveys and auto-generated, impartial reviews.

### 2. Niche College Reviews

- **Link:** [https://www.niche.com/colleges/search/best-professors](https://www.niche.com/colleges/search/best-professors)
- **Type of Source:** Secondary – aggregated college review site.
- **Relation to EduRate:** Competing or comparable system.
- **Description:**  
  Niche aggregates user reviews, rankings, and data about colleges, professors, and student life. The data is collected through surveys and optional open-text reviews.
- **Feature Analysis:**  
  Niche’s structured survey approach aligns with EduRate's idea, but it still allows free-text responses. EduRate would eliminate open-text feedback entirely, using only structured, survey-based ratings to generate reviews—improving neutrality and reducing toxicity.

### 3. Glassdoor

- **Link:** [https://www.glassdoor.com](https://www.glassdoor.com)
- **Type of Source:** Secondary – workplace review site.
- **Relation to EduRate:** Inspirational model for structured feedback.
- **Description:**  
  Glassdoor lets employees rate their workplaces and provide feedback on company culture, management, pay, etc. It includes structured ratings and optional anonymous reviews.
- **Feature Analysis:**  
  Glassdoor demonstrates the value of anonymous, structured input in a feedback system. Like EduRate, it aims to help users make informed decisions. However, it still permits text feedback that can be biased. EduRate eliminates this risk through automated summaries.
