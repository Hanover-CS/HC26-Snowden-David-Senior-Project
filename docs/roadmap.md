# **EduRate: My Web Application to make students Informed**
- The goal of this project is to create a functional web application for my fellow students to further inform them  about suggested or disapproved courses and professors.
  In order to inforce the integrity of the web application a review will be automatically generated for courses and professors based on the scores of an assigned survery. This allows the students to still find the nesscary knowledge they need to make a informed decision on there schedules without spreading hate about our facilty.

## **Key Capabilites**
- Survey-Based Feedback: Students rate courses and professors using structured surveys instead of writing free-form reviews.

- Auto-Generated Reviews: The system analyzes survey results to automatically generate clear, neutral summaries.

- Upvoting System: Reviews can be upvoted, helping highlight the most credible and helpful feedback.

- Integrity Focused: Prevents hate speech or personal attacks by removing open-ended review submissions.

- Course & Professor Lookup: Students can easily browse or search for reviews before registering.
