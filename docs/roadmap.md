# **Web Application Overview**
- The goal of this project is to create a functional web application for my fellow students to further inform them about suggested or disapproved courses and professors.
  In order to inforce the integrity of the web application a review will be automatically generated for courses and professors based on the scores of an assigned survery. This     allows the students to still find the nesscary knowledge they need to make a informed decision on there schedules without spreading hate about our facility.

- More specific to the functionality of the product I would like to embed upvotes for each review so students can understand the crediability behind each review.

## **Week 1 & 2: Planning and Setup**
- Establishing the tech stack will come down to four different factors: **Frontend**, **Backend**, **Database**, and **Hosting**.
- I must create my github repositiory and set up project folders and basic file structure.
